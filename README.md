Acorn Assassin is a tower defense game with a slightly different mechanic. There are no upgrades to the towers, and you instead move between fixed towers to throw acorns at pedestrians. You have limited acorns (10 max) and you ahve ot run back to the main tree to get more ammo.

* Audio
	* Background music
	* rustling from moving
	* squirrel chatter
	* human chatter
		* whistling
		* nonsense conversation
	*acorn hits
		* “Hey!”
		* “What the!”

* Start screen

* win screen
 
* lose screen

* models and animations
	* humans
	* squirrel
	
* animations and particle effects for leaping from tree to tree

## Blue sky upgrades:
* birds collect in a tree and when you move to that tree, it scares the birds into attacking the closest enemy
	
* People don't die, they turn around and exit the way they came (rebuild target queue)
	
* Squirrel jumps if tree is adjacent, if not, he runs along the ground
	
* more complex camera
	* up and down, as well as push in
		
* Acorns bounce off enemies and affect their path and speed (fight or flight)
	
* powerups
	* speed boost
	* fire rate boost
